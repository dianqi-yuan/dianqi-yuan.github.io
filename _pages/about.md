Thanks for visting my page! 

I am a dedicated demographer focused on elderly well-being. My research includes taste preferences and health in older adults and rural left-behind elderly, with publications in notable journals. I seeks to explore the impact of individual behaviors on health outcomes from a life-course perspective and investigate the interplay between social determinants and health.
